I'm an undergraduate senior at the University of California, Berkeley double majoring in Physics and Computer Science. My interests lie at the intersection of physics problems and intellgient machine learning solutions. I see physics systems and environments as ideal sandboxes to explore areas like learning abstract representations and robustness & generalization, since these systems have fundamental, well-defined dynamics and data relationships.

I'm also interested in algorithms, optimization methods, particle physics, and M&Ms. I like playing the violin, playing badminton, and talking to the many voices in my head.
